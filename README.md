Node/Express App - WeLoveMovies
Project Pitch:
The aim of this web application is to provide the user with a movie review and information site, similar to IMDB.
This is a Node.js, express, and knex application. The backend supplements a front end that lets a user search for a movie, get information on said movie.
The user can also find a theater that is showing the searched for movie. This application also has a reviews route,
when the user goes to this route they can see the reviews for that movie.
